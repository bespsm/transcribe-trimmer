the indefinite article takes two forms
it’s the word a when it precedes a word
that begin with a consistent
it’s the word an when it precedes a word
that begins with a vowel
the indefinite article indicates that a noun
refers to a general idea rather than a particular thing
for example you might ask your friend
should i bring a gift to the party
your friend will understand that you are not asking
type of gift or a specific item
i am going to bring an apple pie
your friend tells you
again the indefinite article indicates
she is not talking about a specific apple pie
your friend probably doesn’t even have any pie yet
