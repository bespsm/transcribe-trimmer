The indefinite article takes 2 forms.
It is the word a when it precedes a word
that begin with a consistent.
It’s the word an when it precedes a world
that begin with a vowel.
The definite article indicates that noun
refers to a general idea rather than a particular thing?
For example, you may ask your friend,
Shall I bring a gift to the party?
Your friend will understand that you are not masking
type of gift or a specific item.
“I'm going to bring an apple pie,“
your friend tells you.
Again the definite article indicates
she is not talking about a specific apple pie.
Your friend probably does not even have any pie yet.
